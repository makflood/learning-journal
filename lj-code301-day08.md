# LJ Code 301 - Day 8   
Today we had a brief introduction to SQL. We only covered the basic commands in SQL to carry out CRUD operations. We did not really discuss the minutia of how to actually go about making these queries, just the nomenclature. We also reviewed how NPM works with a project that you start or one you fork.  

The material today was not very difficult, since we had already gone over what CRUD is and the operations for HTTP requests. Also, we had already gone over in detail the architecture of our app, so it wasn't too difficult to figure out how things connect to each other. Excited to actually learn how to *use* SQL with Postgres now that I have a better idea of how to add the queries into the server.
