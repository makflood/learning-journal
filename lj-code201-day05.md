# LJ Code 201 - Day 5
Today was mainly just review of the week: functions, conditionals, etc.  

Not much new in today's lab either... We did some tricky things with invoking functions within other functions and passing a value into a function and reassigning it to itself. However, this was nothing new for me.  

All in all, pretty easy day overall. Had a lot of fun helping some of my classmates wrap their minds around the functions within functions!
