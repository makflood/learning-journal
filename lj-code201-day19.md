# LJ Code 201 - Day 19   
Fourth day of project week!  

Worked on finishing up the project. Everything is looking great with the styling we decided on. Josh and I both worked on mocking up color schemes, then we ended up combining them together to create the scheme of grey with yellow highlights.  

We finally added in the drum kit selection, and I adjusted the encoding for export so that the drum kit used is encoded as well. Overall, we finished up all the features we were working on and did quite a bit of debugging.
