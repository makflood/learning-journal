# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
The main focus of today was git and GitHub. We touched a bit CSS and conditionals, but that was nothing new for me.  

The information about git was very helpful for my understanding. After reading the tutorial in the pre-work for the class, I had a good idea of how git worked and the concepts behind version control. However, I could not really figure out how everything was tied together. How did git interact with GitHub? How are you supposed to change your files? But today really cleared this up. Actually working with files did wonders for my understanding. It actually seems much more straightforward than I originally felt.  

Well, we are only working with a single branch at this point...  


Teaching others git, really cements git commands in my memory.
