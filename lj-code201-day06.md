# LJ Code 201 - Day 6
DOM manipulation today. Also introduced objects and how to create objects without a constructor.  

The theory behind the objects was basically the same as what I learned in my Computer Science classes. However, it does seem a bit odd to create objects from scratch rather than instantiating an object from a class. I wonder if there is way to create classes in JavaScript. It would probably just consist of putting a constructor function in a separate file, or something like that.  

The DOM manipulation does not seem like it should be exceptionally difficult, since it is just a tree. The main problem seems to be setting up the HTML in order to make this manipulation as easy as possible.
