# LJ Code 301 - Day 5   
Today we basically only worked on the lab assignment. We worked together as a class to build out a new page for the blog we are working on, to add the ability to create new articles.  

Once we made sure that everyone was working off the same code base, we followed along as the instructor explained and typed out a form on the new HTML document and the corresponding code in the JS file. We accessed the data given by the user to create a new Article object and then displayed a preview of what the article will look like.  

Overall, the most interesting thing we learned today was ternary operators. I always wondered what those ?'s were doing in the middle of the code in Stack Overflow.
