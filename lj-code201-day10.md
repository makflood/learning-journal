# LJ Code 201 - Day 10
Continued the review of the last two weeks and added a bit of CSS.  

While I already had a pretty good understanding of the material and how to use, at least a simple, event listener, it was nice to see a different way to go about solving the same problem in a different way. It was interesting that the way that Duncan created a table though JavaScript was rather similar to my own.  

The CSS covered today was stuff I had already learned, however the CSS challenge we did in lab was actually quite difficult for my team. To put it simply, we paid too much attention to detail. While we did get basically everything on the page and made our page look very close to the original, we spent quite a bit of our time tweaking the pixels to make it look precisely right. Might need to work on focusing more on getting approximately the right thing before fixing the details, rather than perfecting it as we work our way down the page. In any case, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
