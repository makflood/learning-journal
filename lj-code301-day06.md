# LJ Code 301 - Day 6   
We started discussing servers and AJAX server requests today. Went over the details of how a user interacts with the internet and how loading a web page works.  

So far, we have only done how to make 'GET' requests using AJAX through jQuery. Since we are only using local files at this point in time, this seems to be pretty similar to storing things in localStorage. In order to get more practice with 'GET' requests I would like to try using data from some other API to create an application. I am also excited to see how to store the data in an external database.
