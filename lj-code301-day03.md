# LJ Code 301 - Day 3   
Today we discussed applying event listeners using jQuery. It is very similar to applying event listeners in vanilla JavaScript. One point of convenience that is different though is that 'this' refers to the element that was clicked, basically event.target in vanilla JS.  

Today's lab was pretty straight-forward since much of the more difficult points were already completed in the starter code. One sticking point was finding the selector necessary to allow jQuery to pick the correct elements from the page. Since I have not used attribute selectors before, it was a bit tricky to find the correct selector at first. It all worked out in the end.
