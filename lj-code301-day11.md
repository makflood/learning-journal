# LJ Code 301 - Day 11   
Learned how to create routes for the user in the client side code today. This will be very useful, especially since most of the lab work we have been doing is on a single page app. Now we can give the appearance of a new page every time the user chooses a different section on the page.  

We only used page.js today to achieve this, but it seems to be a very powerful tool. I am curious how page.js goes about intercepting the server requests to create these new routes. I would think that would be quite difficult to accomplish.
