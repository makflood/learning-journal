# LJ Code 201 - Day 16   
First day of project week!  

I am super excited to work on this drum machine. Josh had already played around and figured out how to make the keyboard play audio files. However, we ended up going with making a grid that constantly loops and plays the drums that you have filled in.  

Everyone in the group worked together on one computer to create the basic grid drum machine, since it was difficult to split it up amongst the group. We initially looped the entire measure and had the drums play by setting delays for each one, but that was going to make everything else more complicated. Thus, with some advice from Duncan, we looped each individual beat while keeping track of where we were in the measure instead. This made adding more drums while it was playing much, much easier.  

All in all, we finished the objective we set out to do by ~2pm and thus began doing some of our stretch goals.
