# LJ Code 301 - Day 15   
General review today of the last week of material. Spent the first hour of class debugging the solution to the lab yesterday. Apparently they did not realize that much of the routing in the blog is broken if you go to the page directly through the URL bar.  

The rest of the day was spent planning out what project we want to do. Unfortunately our initial plan did not pan out because we were denied access to the API, but we came up with another idea that should work pretty well. We are going to create an app that shows you local concerts for the time frame that you give. We are going to use the TicketMaster API, which is extremely well documented, they even have a section were you can see the information you get back for different requests, much like Postman.  

Overall, we got our problem domain diagram written out and the mobile version of our page decently wireframed. Going to mess about with the API this weekend, but I think we will do pretty well this week.
