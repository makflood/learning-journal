# LJ Code 201 - Day 8
Started learning event handlers today. Learned how to do a simple event listener that only calls a single function with no arguments to handle the event. This is entirely new for me, but makes a lot of sense. The only part that seems a bit odd is that a variable that holds a function is passed into the listener without being invoked. It seems that it would be difficult to have a function that takes arguments as the event handler.  

Forms in HTML are pretty straightforward. I learned how to use forms in my Web Design class, so the making and styling of the form is nothing new. However, in that class we used a pre-built PHP form handler to send emails, rather than handling the form with JavaScript. I am curious if JavaScript could be used to send emails as well.
