# LJ Code 201 - Day 13  
The focus of today was how JavaScript stores things. Discussed how variables hold references to objects, arrays, and functions. Also about how to make use of localStorage to save data. It was nice to know that the variables in JavaScript generally act the same as the variables in Java.  

I was excited to finally be able to store information beyond a single instance of a browser window. This will allow me to make much more extensive applications. It doesn't seem like using localStorage is too difficult and JSON is really useful. I'm looking forward to see what else we can do using this storage.
