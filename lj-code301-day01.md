# LJ Code 301 - Day 1   
Today was the first day of Code 301! I am excited to work on something entirely new in this class, like frameworks and servers.  

We started today's class with a basic overview of the course and going over the syllabus. Then we discussed responsive web design and how to make a responsive site using @media tags and the importance of setting the viewport. We finished up today's lecture by discussing the assignment and looking thorough the starter code.  

Today's lab was paired programming with Spencer. We completed the assignment quickly because there were only 5 corrections to make and they were generally only a single line. Overall, a pretty good first day.
