# LJ Code 201 - Day 11  
Mainly review of CSS again today, with a bit of media added in. Briefly discussed video and audio tags.  

The lab today was a bit more difficult because it made use of the event listener in a more complicated way. The actual generation of the random images and displaying them was not very difficult. It was much more difficult to make an event handler that displays new images. I think that part of the reason I was having issues was that I was trying to do everything without using any global variables. I decided to go back to using them in the end.  

I also went to the JSHackers Hack Night, which was pretty chill. Met some new people and finished up the code for my lab today.
