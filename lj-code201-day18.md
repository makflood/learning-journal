# LJ Code 201 - Day 18   
Third day of project week!  

Finished my encoding for exporting. Everything basically worked as planned, the only problem was choosing a starting character that did not include invisible characters in the available range. But even so, I was able to encode the current setup of drums and the tempo. When we finish adding the change of kits, I will add the encoding of the current drum kit.  

We finally started adding styles today. Got the boxes into a nice layout so everything is visible at the same time. Also, I got the keys on the piano to stay in the right place and stretch as the screen grows and shrinks. A banana which dances to the beat was added to the top of the page, so the project has been renamed Banana Beats.
