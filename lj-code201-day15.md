# LJ Code 201 - Day 15   
Today we did a whirlwind tour of what to expect in Code 301. I am excited to add in server capabilities to what we have already been learning.  

We also learned about inheritance today. I already knew the theory of inheritance since we used it quite a lot in extending Java classes, but it seems much more convoluted in JavaScript. It makes sense not to use inheritance since you do not want to tie different parts of your code too closely together and possibly create a domino effect of breaking code by changing one thing. However, at the same time, I feel like all of the code is inherently tied together and therefore this domino effect will happen regardless.  

Projects also got assigned today. While my idea did not get picked, I am very excited to work on the drum machine project I was assigned to. It is completely different from anything I have done before, so I think it will be a lot of fun!
